# Sierra Chart C++ Build Status

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ Linking Issues - Need CMake

---

## Progress

✅ **Completed:**
1. gRPC installed via vcpkg
2. Protobuf files generated successfully
3. C++ code compiles without errors
4. Visual Studio 2025 Insiders detected

❌ **Blocked:**
- Linking fails due to complex library dependencies
- 223 unresolved external symbols
- Missing: absl flags, time utilities, utf8_range

---

## Issue

The manual linking with `link.exe` is too complex for gRPC which has:
- 100+ Abseil libraries
- Multiple upb libraries  
- Complex dependency chain

---

## Solution: Use CMake

CMake will automatically handle all library dependencies.

### Option 1: Build with CMake (RECOMMENDED)

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Nexus AI\Documents\NEXUS\sierra_chart"

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Build
cmake --build . --config Release

# Result: build/Release/NexusAI.dll
```

### Option 2: Simplify - Remove gRPC for Now

Create a simpler version without gRPC:
- Export Level 1 & 2 data to files
- Use REST API instead of gRPC
- Add gRPC later when working

### Option 3: Use Pre-built gRPC Package

Install gRPC with all dependencies pre-linked.

---

## Recommendation

**Use CMake!** It's designed for this exact scenario.

The `CMakeLists.txt` file is already created and will:
1. Find all gRPC libraries automatically
2. Link everything correctly
3. Handle dependencies

---

## Next Steps

1. Install CMake: `vcpkg install cmake:x64-windows`
2. Run CMake build (see Option 1 above)
3. Or move to NinjaTrader 8 C# (much simpler!)

---

**C# for NinjaTrader 8 will be 10x easier** - no complex linking!
