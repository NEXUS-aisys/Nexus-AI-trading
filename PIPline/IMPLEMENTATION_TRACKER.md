   - **Impact:** Cannot load ONNX models
   - **Status:** ⏳ NEEDS SOLUTION
   - **Options:**
     - Pure Python ONNX interpreter (complex)
     - Extract weights to JSON and reimplement (time-consuming)
     - Request security exception for onnxruntime (unlikely)

2. **PKL Model Loading**
   - **Issue:** Cannot use `pickle` module (forbidden import)
   - **Impact:** Cannot load XGBoost/LightGBM models
   - **Status:** ⏳ NEEDS SOLUTION
   - **Options:**
     - Export model weights to JSON
     - Reimplement inference in pure Python
     - Use alternative serialization

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISKS

1. **Performance Impact**
   - **Risk:** Pure Python inference may be slower than ONNX/compiled
   - **Mitigation:** Optimize critical paths, use numpy where allowed
   - **Status:** Monitor during testing

2. **Model Accuracy**
   - **Risk:** Manual reimplementation may introduce bugs
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive validation against original models
   - **Status:** Will validate in Phase 4
