## üîÑ PIPELINE FLOW SUMMARY

```
Data ‚Üí L1: Quality/Volatility/Regime (0.89ms)
     ‚Üí L2: 20 Strategies (Parallel)
     ‚Üí L3: Meta-Learning Weights (0.108ms) ‚≠ê NEW
     ‚Üí L4: Signal Aggregation (0.237ms)
     ‚Üí L5: Model Governance + Routing (0.146ms) ‚≠ê NEW
     ‚Üí L6: Risk + Confidence (1.7ms)
     ‚Üí L7: Execute
     ‚Üí L8: Monitor (Async)

Total Latency: ~2.38ms per symbol
Capacity: 420 symbols/second
```

## üéØ WHAT'S NEW

### **Meta-Learning Layer (Layer 3)**
**Problem Solved**: 
- Old: Simple voting (14 SELL beats 6 BUY)
- New: Dynamic weights (BUY can win if trusted more)

**How It Works:**
```python
# Old approach:
if sell_votes > buy_votes:
    signal = SELL

# New approach:
weighted_signal = Œ£(signal_i √ó weight_i √ó confidence_i)
# Weights assigned by Meta-Strategy Selector based on market conditions
```

### **Model Governance (Layer 5)**
- Dynamically adjusts trust in models based on recent performance
- Routes decisions through best-performing models
- Flags models needing retraining

### **7-Layer Risk Check (Layer 6)**
- Margin, VaR, Position limits
- Daily/weekly loss limits
- Drawdown limits
- Final approval gate
